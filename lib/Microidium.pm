=head1 DESCRIPTION

=for HTML <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWbOnrrJGNI"><img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/DWbOnrrJGNI/0.jpg" /></a></p>

This has a number of dependencies that should all be available from CPAN. Run
C<perl Makefile.PL> to get a list of dependencies that you still need to
install.

=head1 INSTALLATION

It might be necessary to download Nvidia Inspector, use the Profile Settings,
find the perl process, and set "Enable application for Optimus" to
SHIM_RENDERING_MODE_USER_EDITABLE.

Running this and using the new hardlink can also help to result in usage of the
correct GPU:

    mklink /H gpu-chrome.exe chrome.exe

To install the dependency L<Acme::MITHALDU::BleedingOpenGL> on Apple machines
you might need to step in manually and run Makefile.PL with this parameter:

    perl Makefile.PL interface=FREEGLUT
